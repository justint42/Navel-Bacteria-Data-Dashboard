## Purpose 

This interactive web dashboard allows users to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the diversity of microbial species colonizing human navels. . The goal is an engaging visualization that enables the public to explore the dataset and patterns within this unique microbiome ecosystem, leveraging interactive web technologies to bring the data to life.

## Conclusion

Using interactive charts and filters, the dashboard reveals that while most people share a small set of common "belly button bacteria", there is also significant individual variation in the thousands of rarer OTUs (operational taxonomic units) present. 

Additionally, three more phenomena can be observed from the visualization.

* The most common bacteria found were Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium species, normally present on human skin.
* Bacterial communities varied with a personâ€™s age, gender, and whether they were innies or outies.
* The navel can be seen as a unique microbial habitat, with some similarities to environments like compost and soil.
