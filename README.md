## Purpose 

This interactive web dashboard allows users to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the diversity of microbial species colonizing human navels. Using interactive charts and filters, the dashboard reveals that while most people share a small set of common "belly button bacteria", there is also significant individual variation in the thousands of rarer OTUs (operational taxonomic units) present. The goal is an engaging visualization that enables the public to explore the dataset and patterns within this unique microbiome ecosystem, leveraging interactive web technologies to bring the data to life.
